## 📁 AI Support explanation
- I used IBM tools to generate the basic HTML layout, form design, and content ideas. It helped me focus more on flow and user interaction instead of figuring everything out from scratch.

AI helps me get unstuck, but the look, layout, and final polish are fully mine. I make sure it feels personal, not just “generated”
